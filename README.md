# DigiSignID

An IC-blockchain-based Digital Signature Web Application

## Description

This website has 2 main features:
1. Digital Signature - The user can digitally 'sign' a document via the website. Derived features:
* Single Signature - performs a digital signature on a single document
* Batch Signature - perform digital signatures on several documents at once (directly on several documents at once, so later the user can upload many documents of the same size, then select one part of the document to sign â†’ feature automatically signs all documents)
2. Digital Validation - The user can validate certain digital documents. The user will upload a document to the website, then the document publisher and the validity of the document will appear (has it been changed or not).
